            <b><ul>REHABILITATION/RENOVATION OF MULTI-PURPOSE BUILDING AT PUP QC</ul></b>
            <p> Another promise delivered project from the Office of Cong. Ralph Wendel P. Tulfo, Quezon City's 2nd District Representative headed by Atty. Joren Lex A. Tan, Chief of Staff, is the construction of a 4-storey Academic Building. 
                The visit from the DPWH Quezon City First District Engineering Office yesterday guarantees that the project will commence soon this year once the requirements are completed. 
                Considering the state of public tertiary education, such a project is a big help for the campus with the insufficiency of classrooms. 
                Again, our sincere gratitude for a Bago, Progresibo at Walang Korupsyon infrastructure development project inside the PUP Quezon City Campus that is responsive to the needs of the academic community.</p>
